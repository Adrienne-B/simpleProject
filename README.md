# simpleProject
A java "simple" project

## Summary
This project was all about creating questions for the user to entry in information, as well as, uploading random ball numbers
using arrays, compare statements and loops. Since, this was a "beginners" project it was definitley a challenge for me.

### Software used:
Eclipse

### What I learn:
The user can input their answer and random ball numbers can appear

#### Challenges to improve on:
1. Overall just improving on java and when and how to use certain things in order for something to work (for the user's experience). 

#### Random Unexpected Challenges:
N/A

#### Solutions/solving the issue:
1. Always make sure variables' name matches,
2. Make sure there are enough appropriate closing brackets
3. Make sure semicolons are at the very end of any constructors, methods, functions, prints, etc.


#### Weakness so far:
1.	java (since I am learning).
